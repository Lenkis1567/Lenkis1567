### Hi there!
#### Just started this git page in order to fullfill the tasks form my Institute and also to upload some personal projects.
Now I'm learning ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white), ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54), ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-000000.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white), ![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Redux-8A2BE2.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) and others.

Few notes:

- I have been a project manager for more than 20 years, so I can manage whatever appears.
- I adore making websites.
- I wanted to learn how to construct websites for several years and now I'm doing it.
