# Hi! Just trying to explore GitHub.
## Will update the file as soon as I feel more confident it what I'm doing here.

But now just few notes

- I'm not a developer

- I'm changing the profession

- I wanted to learn how to do websites for several years

  - cause it's fan

  - cause they make awful webstes, for example http://itcorp.com/
