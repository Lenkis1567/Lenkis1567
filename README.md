### Hi! Just trying to explore GitHub.
#### Will update the file as soon as I feel more confident it what I'm doing here.
Now I'm learning ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) and ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

But now just few notes

- I'm not a developer but a PR ans SMM manager

- I'm changing the profession

  - cause they make awful webstes
