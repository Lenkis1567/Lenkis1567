#### I'm working as Fronend / Cusomer success manager, dealing mainly with with Angular and .Net.
Few notes:

- I have been a project manager for more than 20 years, so I can manage whatever appears.
- I adore making websites.
- I wanted to learn how to construct websites for several years and now I'm doing it.
- Now I have a full scale of duties: from constucting and correcting some websites to coding new features of our Apps, from SIP to IIS.
