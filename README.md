### Hi there!

#### I'm working as Frontend / Cusomer success manager, dealing mainly with with Angular and .Net.
Few notes:

- I have been a project manager for more than 20 years, so I can manage whatever appears.
- I adore making websites and apps.
- I wanted to learn how to construct websites for several years and now I make them every day
